# Lab 4 - Boosting Operational Efficiency in Product Management with SAP Fiori Automation

## Objective 

To automate Contoso Electronics' product data management and reporting
processes using Power Automate Desktop (PAD). This will assist in
handling and processing large datasets related to product inventory,
performing automated searches, and generating detailed product reports
for internal use. The automation will streamline operational efficiency,
reduce manual effort, and ensure accuracy in data reporting.

## Solution Focus Area 

Contoso Electronics, a leader in consumer electronics, maintains a vast
inventory of products. The current manual product management process,
which involves searching for product information across various
databases and generating reports, has led to several challenges:

1.  **Time-Consuming Searches**: Employees manually search through
    product data, often spending hours filtering through large datasets
    to find relevant information.

2.  **Inefficient Report Generation**: Manually generating detailed
    reports from the gathered data leads to inconsistencies, delays, and
    potential errors.

To enhance internal operational efficiency, Contoso Electronics will
implement Power Automate Desktop to automate the product search and
report generation process. The automation will reduce manual effort,
increase accuracy, and improve overall productivity.
