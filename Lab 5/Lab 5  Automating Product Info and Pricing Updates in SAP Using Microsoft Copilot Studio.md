# Lab 5 - Automating Product Info and Pricing Updates in SAP Using Microsoft Copilot Studio


## Objective 

Develop a lab use case for Contoso Electronics to streamline product
information retrieval and price updates in SAP using Microsoft Copilot
Studio integrated with Power Automate. The solution should help
Contoso's operations team to efficiently query product data, update
prices, and test these updates in SAP, enabling faster decision-making
and operational improvements.

## Solution Focus Area 

Contoso Electronics is continuously updating its product catalogue and
prices based on market trends and promotions. However, the manual
process of querying product information and updating prices in SAP
systems is time-consuming and prone to human error. The goal is to
automate the process by integrating Microsoft Copilot Studio with SAP
via Power Automate, allowing Contoso's team to retrieve product data and
update prices quickly and accurately.

**Key Challenges:**

- **Product Information Retrieval:** Contoso's operations team often
  requires real-time product information to make data-driven decisions.
  However, querying product information from SAP involves manual steps,
  leading to delays.

- **Price Updates:** Keeping product prices up to date in SAP based on
  promotions or market changes is critical but is currently slow and
  inefficient, affecting pricing accuracy.

To address these challenges, Contoso will use Microsoft Copilot Studio
integrated with Power Automate to automate SAP queries and updates,
ensuring accuracy and efficiency in operations.
